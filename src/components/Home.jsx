            <h4>Dowry</h4>
            <h4 class="subheading">Dowries are considered a major contributor towards violence against women in India. Some of these offences include physical violence, emotional abuses, and murder of brides and girls</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">Most dowry deaths occur when the young woman, unable to bear the harassment and torture, commits suicide. Most of these suicides are by hanging, poisoning or by fire. Sometimes the woman is killed by setting her on fire - this is known as bride burning, and is sometimes disguised as suicide or accident.[20] In 2012, 8,233 dowry death cases were reported across India.[21] Dowry issues caused 1.4 deaths per year per 100,000 women in India</p>
